# Peg

Retro roguelike browser-based Plinko built with React, Vite, and Matter.js physics.

## Features

- Physics-driven peg board using Matter.js.
- Coin economy with upgrades and scaling costs.
- Slot progression and payout growth over time.
- Toggleable settings panel with sound on/off and volume slider.
- Main nav tabs for `Play` and `Leaderboard` views.
- Persistent Node.js global leaderboard (file-backed) with top-3 badges and player profile inspection.
- Retro pixel-inspired UI and animated reward floaters.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite 8
- Matter.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or current LTS)
- npm

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Optional env var for custom API target (frontend):

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=""
```

Leave it empty for local Vite proxy behavior.

### Run Leaderboard Server

```bash
npm run server
```

Run `npm run dev` and `npm run server` in separate terminals during development.

The frontend calls `/api/*` and is proxied to `http://localhost:3001` in development.

### Netlify / Static Hosting Notes

Netlify hosts this frontend as static files only. The leaderboard API must be deployed separately (for example Render, Railway, Fly.io, or your own server).

Set a Netlify environment variable so the frontend points to your deployed backend:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com`

Then redeploy the site.

Also allow your Netlify site origin in backend CORS settings.

### Emergency Shutdown / Read-Only Mode

If you need to contain an incident quickly:

- Set `EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN=true` on the backend to return `503` for every request.
- Set `READ_ONLY_MODE=true` on the backend to keep reads available but block `POST /api/leaderboard/submit`.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN="true"
npm run server
```

Or keep the leaderboard visible while stopping new writes:

```powershell
$env:READ_ONLY_MODE="true"
npm run server
```

If the backend is deployed on Render, Railway, Fly.io, or similar, set the same environment variable in the host dashboard and redeploy/restart the service.

### Global Persistent Mode (MongoDB Atlas)

To make the leaderboard persistent globally (shared by all users and not tied to one local machine), run the server with a hosted MongoDB database:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and database user.
2. Add your app host/IP to Atlas network access.
3. Set environment variable `MONGODB_URI` before starting the server.

Recommended local setup:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root.
2. Add your Atlas URI:

```env
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

3. Load it in your terminal session before running the server (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
	if ($_ -match '^\s*#' -or $_ -match '^\s*$') { return }
	$name, $value = $_ -split '=', 2
	$env:$name = $value.Trim('"')
}
npm run server
```

`.env` is ignored by git in `.gitignore`.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
npm run server
```

If `MONGODB_URI` is not set, the server falls back to local file storage (`server/data/leaderboard.json`).

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Gameplay Notes

- Peg collisions can award bonus coins based on upgrade chance.
- Slots level up as they fill, improving payouts.
- Ball count is capped by owned balls.
- Submit your current profile to the global leaderboard from the `Leaderboard` tab.

## Leaderboard API

Base URL (dev): `http://localhost:3001`

- `GET /api/health` - health check
- `GET /api/leaderboard?limit=50` - ranked entries by coins
- `GET /api/leaderboard/:username` - single player profile and rank
- `POST /api/leaderboard/submit` - create/update a player entry

Submission payload fields used by the app:

- `username` (3-20 chars, letters/numbers/spaces/`_`/`-`)
- `coins`
- `totalCoins`
- `totalBalls`
- `upgrades`
- `slotLevels`
- `ownedSkins`
- `selectedSkin`

Data persistence:

- Global mode: MongoDB Atlas (`MONGODB_URI`)
- Local fallback: `server/data/leaderboard.json`
- Entries are updated by username (case-insensitive)

Health endpoint output includes storage mode:

- `storage: "mongo"` for globally persistent mode
- `storage: "file"` for local fallback mode
